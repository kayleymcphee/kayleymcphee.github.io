Hi there. I've been tooling around for a solution to the age-old 'web presence' question for a while! I'm a child of lycos websites and LiveJournal â€“ social media and I don't play well together.
So, here I am with an old-school personal website built enitrely in HTML5 and CSS using Github Pages, Jekyll, and a lot of Googling. When I learned the basics of HTML, frames were still the big new thing!
I'm not sure how often this blog will get updated, so I make no promises, but hopefully it finds some use as this site gets fleshed out.
Thanks for visiting!
