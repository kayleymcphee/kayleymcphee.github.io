<p>Hi there. I've been tooling around for a solution to the age-old 'web presence' question for a while! I'm a child of Lycos websites and LiveJournal â€“ social media and I don't play well together. After recent permanent deletion of Facebook and the planned eventual divorce from Instagram, I need a place to share my creative endeavors and life updates, both professional and personal.</p>
<p>So, here I am with an old-school personal website built enitrely in HTML5 and CSS using Github Pages, Jekyll, and a lot of Googling. When I learned the basics of HTML, frames were the big new thing!</p>
<p>I'm not sure how often this blog will get updated, so I make no promises, but hopefully it finds some use as this site gets fleshed out.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
